abstract ={The model selection literature has been generally poor at reflecting the deep foundations of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and at making appropriate comparisons to the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). There is a clear philosophy, a sound criterion based in information theory, and a rigorous statistical foundation for AIC. AIC can be justified as Bayesian using a “savvy” prior on models that is a function of sample size and the number of model parameters. Furthermore, BIC can be derived as a non-Bayesian result. Therefore, arguments about using AIC versus BIC for model selection cannot be from a Bayes versus frequentist perspective. The philosophical context of what is assumed about reality, approximating models, and the intent of model-based inference should determine whether AIC or BIC is used. Various facets of such multimodel inference are presented here, particularly methods of model averaging.},

@article{austin04,
	Abstract = {Researchers frequently use automated model selection methods such as backwards elimination to identify variables that are independent predictors of an outcome under consideration. We propose using bootstrap resampling in conjunction with automated variable selection methods to develop parsimonious prediction models. Using data on patients admitted to hospital with a heart attack, we demonstrate that selecting those variables that were identified as independent predictors of mortality in at least 60% of the bootstrap samples resulted in a parsimonious model with excellent predictive ability.},
